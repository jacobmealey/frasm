# frasm
MIPS assembler written in Rust

## About
frasm is an assembler written in Rust speicifally for the MIPs architecture. This is my first time writing anything bigger than a 
`Hello, World!` in Rust. As of right now (Oct 2021) it is a relatively dumb assembler that doesn't handle tags and isn't compatible
with any syntax from other assemblers. IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE COMMENTS!
